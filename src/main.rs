//! Bathpack is a tool for automating the packaging of coursework files for submission at the
//! University of Bath, specifically for the BSc/MComp Computer Science degree.
//!
//! Bathpack works by reading a configuration file in TOML format, called `bathpack.toml` by
//! default, describing the locations of source files and destination locations, as well as
//! details about the final folder/archive.
//!
//! Optionally, information about the destination can be specified separately, such as in another
//! TOML file alongside `bathpack.toml` or inside/alongside Bathpack. This way, configurations
//! for specific coursework submissions can be distributed to multiple users.
